/**
 * QMK Switcher Module - Single-key app switching with advanced features
 * 
 * This module enables single-key app switching by simulating hold+tap sequences
 * (like Cmd+Tab on Mac or Alt+Tab on Windows). Features include:
 * - Single key cycling through applications
 * - Secondary key support for advanced actions (quit, hide, etc.)
 * - Keystroke caching during app switcher boot time
 * - Automatic selection via idle timeout
 * - MacOS-specific optimizations (including Expos√© support)
 * 
 * See README.md in this folder for a detailed setup guide.
 *
 * **********
 * 
 * A single 'Switcher' key  can be used anytime a modifier needs to be held while a
 * key is repeatedly tapped. In lieu of a physical key trigger, it's also possible to
 * use combos, tap dances, or any other means to generate the trigger_keycode.
 *
 * Optionally allows for secondary keys, allowing additional actions to be taken
 * without releasing the virtual_hold_key. In the Mac app switcher, this is useful
 * to send a 'Q' while cmd remains held, quitting the highlighted app. This does
 * not require a physical press of the 'Q' key but rather can be triggered by any
 * specified keycode.
 *
 * The virtual_hold_key (cmd in the Mac app switcher case) is released on the press
 * or release of any key other than the specified triggers. This means that if the
 * trigger is on a higher layer and you're holding a layer switch key to access it,
 * the virtual_hold_key will be released as soon as the layer switch key is released.

 *  as follows:
 *  
 *  SWITCHER_SECONDARY_KEYS(
 *    {KC_LEFT, KC_LEFT},     // 'left' functions as usual

 *    {KC_DOWN, KC_DOWN},     // 'down' functions as usual
 *    {KC_A, KC_Q},           // left pinky ('A' on QWERTY) sends 'Q' to quit app
 *    {KC_F, KC_H},           // left index ('F' on QWERTY) sends 'H' to hide app
 *  );
 * 
 *  Any keycodes not specified here will exit the switcher and then be sent for
 *  processing.
